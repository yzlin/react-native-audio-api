# Getting started

The goal of _Fundamentals_ is to guide you through the setup process of the Audio API, as well as to show the basic concepts behind audio programming using a web audio framework, giving you the confidence to explore more advanced use cases on your own. This section is packed with interactive examples, code snippets, and explanations. Are you ready? Let's make some noise!

## What is React Native Audio API?

React Native Audio API is a powerful, high-performant and low-level audio library built by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).
RN Audio API is fully compatible\* with [Web Audio specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), making it easy to write audio-intensive applications for iOS, Android and Web with just one codebase.

## Installation

It takes only a few steps to add Audio API to your project:

### Install the package

Install the `react-native-audio-api` package from npm:

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo install react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add react-native-audio-api

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage with expo

`react-native-audio-api` contains native custom code and isn't part of the Expo Go application. In order to be available in expo managed builds, you have to use Expo development build. Simplest way on starting local expo dev builds, is to use:

<Tabs groupId="expoStart">
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

    npx expo run:ios

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

    npx expo run:android

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To learn more about expo development builds, please check out [Development Builds Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

#### Android

No further steps are necessary.

#### iOS

While developing for iOS, make sure to install [pods](https://cocoapods.org) first before running the app:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

#### Web

No further steps are necessary.

:::caution

`react-native-audio-api` on the web exposes the browser's built-in Web Audio API, but for compatibility between platforms, it limits the available interfaces to APIs that are implemented on iOS and Android.

:::

### Clear Metro bundler cache (recommended)

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>

    npx expo start -c

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm start -- --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn start --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
