# AudioNode

`AudioNode` interface serves as a versatile interface for constructing an audio processing graph, representing individual units of audio processing functionality.
Each `AudioNode` is associated with a certain number of audio channels that facilitate the transfer of audio data through processing graph.

We usually represent the channels with the standard abbreviations detailed in the table below:

| Name | Number of channels | Channels |
| :----: | :------: | :-------- |
| Mono | 1 | 0: M - mono |
| Stereo | 2 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right |
| Quad | 4 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right <br /> 2: SL - surround left <br /> 3: SR - surround right |
| Stereo | 6 | 0: L - left <br /> 1: R - right <br /> 2: C - center <br /> 3: LFE - subwoofer <br /> 4: SL - surround left <br /> 5: SR - surround right |

## Read-only properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `context` | [`BaseAudioContext`](/core/base-audio-context) | Returns the associated context. |
| `numberOfInputs` | `number` | Returns value representing the number of input connections for the node. Source nodes are characterized by having a `numberOfInputs` value of 0. |
| `numberOfOutputs` | `number` | Returns value representing the number of output connections for the node. Destination nodes are characterized by having a `numberOfOutputs` value of 0. |
| `channelCount` | `number` | Returns value representing the number of channels utilized to decide how many channels are engaged during up-mixing or down-mixing with the node's inputs. |
| `channelCountMode` | [`ChannelCountMode`](/types/channel-count-mode) | Returns an enumerated value that specifies the method by which channels are mixed between the node's inputs and outputs. |
| `channelInterpretation` | [`ChannelInterpretation`](/types/channel-interpretation) | Returns an enumerated value that specifies how input channels are mapped to output channels when number of them is different. |

## Methods

### `connect`

The `connect` method lets you connect one of the node's outputs to a destination.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `destination` | [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) | Audio node to which to connect. |

**Returns** `undefined`.

### `disconnect`

The `disconnect` method lets you disconnect one or more nodes from the node.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `destination` <Optional /> | [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) | Audio node to which to connect. |

If no arguments provided node disconnects from all outgoing connections.

**Returns** `undefined`.
