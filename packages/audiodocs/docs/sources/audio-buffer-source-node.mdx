# AudioBufferSourceNode

The `AudioBufferSourceNode` is an [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node) which represents audio source with in-memory audio data, stored in `AudioBuffer`.
You can use it for audio playback, including standard pause and resume functionalities.

An `AudioBufferSourceNode` can be started only once, so if you want to play the same sound again you have to create a new one.
However, this node is very inexpensive to create, and what is crucial you can reuse same [`AudioBuffer`](/sources/audio-buffer).

#### [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node#read-only-properties) properties

<AudioNodePropsTable numberOfInputs={0} numberOfOutputs={1} channelCount={"defined by associated buffer"} channelCountMode={"max"} channelInterpretation={"speakers"} />

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createBufferSource(options)`](/core/base-audio-context#createbuffersource)

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `buffer` | [`AudioBuffer`](/sources/audio-buffer) | Associated `AudioBuffer`. |
| `detune` | [`AudioParam`](/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing detuning of oscillation in cents. |
| `loop` | `boolean` | Boolean indicating if audio data must be replayed after when end of the associated `AudioBuffer` is reached. |
| `loopStart` | `number` | Float value indicating the time, in seconds, at which playback of the audio must begin, if loop is true. |
| `loopEnd` | `number` | Float value indicating the time, in seconds, at which playback of the audio must end and loop back to `loopStart`, if loop is true. |
| `playbackRate` | [`AudioParam`](/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` defining speed factor at which the audio will be played. |

## Methods

### `start` <Overridden />

The above method schedules `AudioBufferSourceNode` to start playback of audio data contained in the associated `AudioBuffer`, or starts to play immediately.

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---- |
| `when` | `number` | The time, in seconds, at which the node will start to play. |
| `offset` <Optional /> | `number` | An offset, in seconds, determines the starting point for audio playback. |
| `duration` <Optional /> | `number` | The duration, in seconds, of audio playback. |

#### Errors:

| Error type | Description |
| :---: | :---- |
| `RangeError` | `when` is negative number. |
| `RangeError` | `offset` is negative number. |
| `RangeError` | `duration` is negative number. |
| `InvalidStateError` | If node has already been started once. |

#### Returns `undefined`.

## Remarks

#### `buffer`
- If is null, it outputs a single channel of silence (all samples are equal to 0).

#### `detune`
- Default value is 0.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 100 detune the source up by one semitone, whereas -1200 down by one octave.
- When `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range -1200 to 1200.

#### `loop`
- Default value is false.

#### `loopStart`
- Default value is 0.

#### `loopEnd`
- Default value is `buffer.duration`.

#### `playbackRate`
- Default value is 1.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 1.0 plays audio at normal speed, whereas value of 2.0 plays audio twice as fast as normal speed.
- When created with `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range 0 to 3 and uses pitch correction algorithm.
