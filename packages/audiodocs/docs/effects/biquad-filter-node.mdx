# BiquadFilterNode

The `BiquadFilterNode` interface represents a low-order filter. It is an [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node) used for tone controls, graphic equalizers, and other audio effects.
Multiple `BiquadFilterNode` instances can be combined to create more complex filtering chains.

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createBiquadFilter()`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#createbiquadfilter)

## Properties

It inherits all properties from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties).

| Name | Type |  Rate  | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :----------: | :-- |
| `frequency` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) | The filter’s cutoff or center frequency in hertz (Hz). |
| `detune` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) | Amount by which the frequency is detuned in cents. |
| `Q` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) | The filter’s Q factor (quality factor). |
| `gain` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) | Gain applied by specific filter types, in decibels (dB). |
| `type` | [`BiquadFilterType`](#biquadfiltertype-enumeration-description) | — | Defines the kind of filtering algorithm the node applies (e.g. `"lowpass"`, `"highpass"`). |

#### BiquadFilterType enumeration description
Note: The detune parameter behaves the same way for all filter types, so it is not repeated below.
| `type` | Description | `frequency` | `Q` | `gain` |
|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:------:|
| `lowpass` | Second-order resonant lowpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff. Frequencies below the cutoff pass through; higher frequencies are attenuated. | The cutoff frequency. | Determines how peaked the frequency is around the cutoff. Higher values result in a sharper peak. | Not used |
| `highpass` | Second-order resonant highpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff. Frequencies above the cutoff pass through; lower frequencies are attenuated. | The cutoff frequency. | Determines how peaked the frequency is around the cutoff. Higher values result in a sharper peak.  | Not used |
| `bandpass` | Second-order bandpass filter. Frequencies within a given range pass through; others are attenuated. | The center of the frequency band. | Controls the bandwidth. Higher values result in a narrower band. | Not used |
| `lowshelf` | Second-order lowshelf filter. Frequencies below the cutoff are boosted or attenuated; others remain unchanged. | The upper limit of the frequencies where the boost (or attenuation) is applied. | Not used | The boost (in dB) to be applied. Negative values attenuate the frequencies.|
| `highshelf` | Second-order highshelf filter. Frequencies above the cutoff are boosted or attenuated; others remain unchanged. | The lower limit of the frequencies where the boost (or attenuation) is applied. | Not used | The boost (in dB) to be applied. Negative values attenuate the frequencies. |
| `peaking` | Frequencies around a center frequency are boosted or attenuated; others remain unchanged. | The center of the frequency range where the boost (or an attenuation) is applied. | Controls the bandwidth. Higher values result in a narrower band. | The boost (in dB) to be applied. Negative values attenuate the frequencies. |
| `notch` | Notch (band-stop) filter. Opposite of a bandpass filter: frequencies around the center are attenuated; others remain unchanged. | The center of the frequency range where the notch is applied. | Controls the bandwidth. Higher values result in a narrower band. | Not used |
| `allpass` | Second-order allpass filter. All frequencies pass through, but changes the phase relationship between the various frequencies. | The frequency where the center of the phase transition occurs (maximum group delay). | Controls how sharp the phase transition is at the center frequency. Higher values result in a sharper transition and a larger group delay. | Not used |

## Methods

It inherits all methods from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#methods).

### `getFrequencyResponse`

| Parameters | Type | Description |
| :--------: | :--: | :---------- |
| `frequencyArray` | `Float32Array` | Array of frequencies (in Hz), which you want to filter. |
| `magResponseOutput` | `Float32Array` | Output array to store the computed linear magnitude values for each frequency. For frequencies outside the range [0, $\frac{sampleRate}{2}$], the corresponding results are NaN. |
| `phaseResponseOutput` | `Float32Array` | Output array to store the computed phase response values (in radians) for each frequency. For frequencies outside the range [0, $\frac{sampleRate}{2}$], the corresponding results are NaN. |
| `length` | `number` | The number of frequency values to process. It should match the length of all input and output arrays. |

#### Returns `undefined`.

## Remarks

#### `frequency`
- Float. Default: 350.
- Range: [10, $\frac{sampleRate}{2}$].

#### `detune`
- Float. Default: 0.

#### `Q`
- Float. Default: 1.
- Range:
  - For `lowpass` and `highpass` is [-Q, Q], where Q is the largest value for which $10^{Q/20}$ does not overflow the single-precision floating-point representation.
Numerically: Q ≈ 770.63678.
  - For `bandpass`, `notch`, `allpass`, and `peaking`: Q is related to the filter’s bandwidth and should be positive.
  - Not used for `lowshelf` and `highshelf`.

#### `gain`
- Float. Default: 0.
- Range: [-40, 40].
- Positive values correspond to amplification; negative to attenuation.

#### `type`
- [`BiquadFilterType`](#biquadfiltertype-enumeration-description). Default: `"lowpass"`.
