# GainNode

The `GainNode` interface represents the change in volume (amplitude) of the audio signal.
It is an [`AudioNode`](/core/audio-node) that applies given gain to processing audio data.

Direct gain modification often results in unpleasant 'clicks'. To avoid this effect, utilize exponential interpolation methods from the [`AudioParam`](/core/audio-param).

#### Envelope - ADSR

Envelope is term widely used in music and sound engineering, it describes how a sound changes over time.
The most common way of describing an envelope is ADSR. This acronym stands for: **attack**, **decay**, **sustain** and **release**.

- **Attack** - the time it takes for the sound to reach its peak volume from the beginning.
- **Decay** - the time it takes for the sound to reach the sustain level after the peak volume.
- **Sustain** - the volume level that the sound will stay at until the key is released.
- **Release** - the time it takes for the sound to fade out after the key is released.
