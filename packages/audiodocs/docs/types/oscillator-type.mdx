# OscillatorType

`OscillatorType` is a string that specifies shape of an oscillator wave

```jsx
type OscillatorType =
  | 'sine'
  | 'square'
  | 'sawtooth'
  | 'triangle'
  | 'custom';
```

Below you can see possible names with shapes corresponding to them.

## `custom`

This value can't be set explicitly, but it allows user to set any shape. See [`setPeriodicWave`](/docs/sources/oscillator-node#setperiodicwave) for reference.
